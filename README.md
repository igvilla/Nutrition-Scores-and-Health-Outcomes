# Nutrition-Score-Regression-and-Health-Outcomes


The main objective of this study is to predict the nutrition score of several food items by utilizing the nutrient makeup provided in the Open Food Facts dataset, followed by testing against the nutrition scores and grades already provided. Since not all food items in the dataset obtain a nutritional score, these can be used as a testing set, while the ones with scores can be used to actually train a model in predicting nutritional scores based off the nutritional makeup of different foods. These nutrition scores will also be compared to health outcomes for the different regions those foods are associated with, which will help in obtaining a better understanding for any correlation between nutrition score and health outcomes, which therefore also ties back and relates to the nutritional makeup of such foods.
This is a supervised learning problem, so we will fit a regression model, allowing us to extract feature importance and understand how these nutritional scores change as our inputs change. Predicting the nutrition score allows for unique insights into which nutrients are more impactful for overall nutrition and allows us to predict nutrition scores for unscored data items.
In the notebook of code provided, the steps taken will be displayed, including plenty of data preprocessing, data analysis (which primarily dealt with handling an overabundance of null values), and finally, the development and fine tuning of a machine learning algorithm.
